# TicTacToe AI

Python implementation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe, enhanced with an artificial intelligence (AI) opponent. The game is built using the Pygame library, and the AI utilizes the minimax algorithm to make decisions.


## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to create an interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game where users can play against each other or against an AI that predicts the player's moves and counters them effectively. The AI is implemented using the minimax algorithm, which is a decision-making algorithm used in decision making and game theory.

## Features
- **Two Modes of Play**: Users can choose to play against another human (Player vs Player) or against the AI (Player vs AI).
- **Intelligent AI**: The AI uses the minimax algorithm to evaluate its moves based on the current state of the game board.
- **Graphical User Interface**: The game features a simple and intuitive interface built with Pygame.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The main programming language used.
- **Pygame**: A Python library for writing video games.
- **Minimax Algorithm**: Used for AI decision making.

## How to Run
To run this game locally, follow these steps:
1. Ensure Python and Pygame are installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the repository in your terminal.
4. Run `python tictactoe.py` to start the game.

## Lessons Learned
This project was instrumental in enhancing my understanding of Python and game development. Implementing the minimax algorithm deepened my knowledge of AI and game theory
